    "# Recurrent Neural Networks\n",
    "So far, the neural network architectures we have been using have been simple in the sense that they take in a single fixed size input and give a single fixed size output. What if we wanted to model something like language where we want to feed in different length words? Another issue is that each output is only dependent on the current input. It has no 'memory' of previous inputs. Recurrent neural networks address both these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "They do this by having an internal hidden state which can be thought of as a form of memory. At each time step, the new hidden state is calculated as a function of the previous hidden state and the current input. This hidden state can then be used to represent your output or can be put through another function to compute the outputs. When we say function we are referring to the same one used in standard neural network: linear combination followed by an activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $h_t = f(x_t, h_{t-1})$\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the diagram below, which uses a further function to compute the output $o$ from the hidden state $s$, there are three matrices of parameters which we are trying to optimize: U, V and W. The diagram also demonstrates how these networks can be unfolded to show the variables at various time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](rnn.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard neural networks can only model one to one relationships while RNNs are extremely flexible in terms of input-output structures which is one of the reasons they are so powerful. You can imagine something like one to many being used to feed in a single image from which a caption is sequentially produced or a many to one being used to feed in a sentence sequentially and give a single output describing the sentiment of the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](rnnlayouts.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization\n",
    "Surprisingly, with this increased complexity in structure, the optimization method does not become any more difficult. Despite having a different name, back-propagation through time, it is essentially the same thing. All you do is feed in your sequence sequentially to get the output, as usual. You then just calculate your error at each timestep and sum it as opposed to calculating the error at a single timestep like standard neural networks. Then you can use gradient descent to update your weights iteratively until you are satisfied with your network's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "RNNS are generally slower to optimize than standard neural networks as the output at each time step is dependent on the previous output so the operations cannot be parallelized.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a long time it was considered difficult to train RNNs due to two problems called vanishing and exploding gradients. These problems also exist in standard neural network but are greatly emphasized in RNNs. However, modern techniques such as LSTM cells have greatly reduced this difficulty."
